# 🌟 Drosera Node Auto-Installer 🌟

This repository provides an automated installation script for setting up a Drosera node. Follow the instructions below to install and configure the node using the provided script.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- 💻 A VPS running Ubuntu (preferably 20.04 or 22.04).
- 🔑 Root access or a user with sudo privileges.
- 🌐 Stable internet connection.
- 🧠 Basic knowledge of terminal commands.

## 🚀 Installation Steps

### 1. Start a Screen Session 🖥️
To ensure the installation process continues even if your SSH session disconnects, use the `screen` command to create a persistent session.

Run the following command to start a new screen session named `dresora`:
```bash
screen -S dresora
```
This will open a new screen session where you can run the installation script.

### 2. Notes on Using Screen 📋

**Why use `screen`?** It allows the installation to continue running in the background if your terminal session is interrupted (e.g., due to network issues).

#### Basic Screen Commands:
- 🔄 **Detach from the session**: Press `Ctrl + A`, then `D` to detach and return to your main terminal. The session will keep running.
- ↩️ **Reattach to the session**: Run `screen -r dresora` to return to the `dresora` session.
- 📜 **List all screen sessions**: Run `screen -ls` to see all active sessions.
- ❌ **Exit the session**: When done, type `exit` inside the screen session to close it.

If `screen` is not installed, you can install it with:
```bash
sudo apt install screen
```

### 3. Run the Auto-Installer Script 🛠️
Inside the `dresora` screen session, execute the following command to download and run the auto-installer script directly from GitHub:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/idnodefiqul/Auto-Install-Node-Dresora/main/autodresora.sh | bash
```
This command will:
- 📥 Download the `autodresora.sh` script from the repository.
- ⚙️ Execute it in your terminal, installing all required dependencies and configuring the Drosera node.

### 4. Follow the Script's Instructions 📝
The script is interactive and will prompt you for inputs during execution, such as:
- 🧑‍💻 GitHub username and email.
- 🔐 Private key for deployment.
- 💼 Operator ETH wallet address.
- ✅ Confirmation to proceed after depositing Bloom Boost ETH on Holesky.

Follow the on-screen prompts carefully to complete the installation. The script will:
- 📦 Install dependencies (Docker, Foundry, Bun, etc.).
- 🛠️ Configure the Drosera node and operator CLI.
- 🔄 Set up a systemd service for the node.
- 🔒 Configure the firewall.

### 5. Post-Installation ✅
After the script completes, it will display useful commands to monitor the node:

- **Check logs**:
  ```bash
  journalctl -u drosera.service -f
  ```
- **Check status**:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status drosera
  ```

**Note**: If the status shows errors or no logs are displayed, try rebooting the VPS with:
```bash
sudo reboot
```

If you detached from the screen session during installation, reattach using:
```bash
screen -r dresora
```

## 🛡️ Troubleshooting

- ⚠️ **Script errors**: If the script fails (e.g., due to missing commands like `droseraup` or `foundryup`), ensure you’re running it in a screen session and check the `PATH`:
  ```bash
  echo $PATH
  source /root/.bashrc
  ```
- 🌐 **Network issues**: If the `curl` command fails, verify your internet connection and try again.
- 🖥️ **Screen issues**: If you can’t reattach to the session, list all sessions with `screen -ls` and ensure the `dresora` session is active.
